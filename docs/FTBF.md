# Fermilab Test Beam Facility experiment

At the FTBF, prototype detectors for collider experiments can be characterized through test beam measurements. This facility offers a unique opportunity as it provides a 120GeV proton beam from the Fermilab Main Injector accelerator. Each Main Injector cycle delivers a single 4.2 s long spill per minute that is tuned to produce approximately 100,000 protons per spill. The beam size can also be adjusted to obtain widths ranging from 2-3 mm up to about 1 cm.
In order to measure the position of each incoming proton, the FTBF is equipped with a silicon tracking telescope consisting of four pixel layers with a cell size of 100 × 150 μm2, and fourteen strip modules with 60 μm pitch, which alternate in orientation along the x- and y- axes. The LGAD chamber was positioned roughly 2 m downstream from the center of the telescope. To identify and eliminate protons that scatter in any material along the beam line, two of the fourteen strip layers are located immediately after the environmental chamber.
